# Security Best Practices

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures and best practices implemented in NextScript to protect your applications, data, and infrastructure.

## Security Architecture

### 1. Authentication

#### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP)
- SMS/Email verification
- Hardware security key support
- Biometric authentication integration

#### Single Sign-On (SSO)
- SAML 2.0 support
- OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect
- Active Directory integration
- Custom identity provider support

### 2. Authorization

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
```json
{
  "roles": {
    "admin": {
      "permissions": ["read", "write", "delete", "manage"],
      "scope": "global"
    },
    "developer": {
      "permissions": ["read", "write"],
      "scope": "project"
    },
    "viewer": {
      "permissions": ["read"],
      "scope": "project"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Resource-Level Permissions
- Project-level access control
- Component-level restrictions
- API endpoint security
- Data access policies

### 3. Data Security

#### Encryption
- Data at rest encryption (AES-256)
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- Secure key management using KMS

#### Data Classification
```yaml
classification_levels:
  - PUBLIC
  - INTERNAL
  - CONFIDENTIAL
  - RESTRICTED
```

### 4. Network Security

#### API Security
- Rate limiting
- Request validation
- Input sanitization
- CORS policies

#### Infrastructure Protection
- Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- DDoS protection
- IP whitelisting
- Network segmentation

## Security Controls

### 1. Access Management

#### Password Policies
```json
{
  "minLength": 12,
  "requireUppercase": true,
  "requireLowercase": true,
  "requireNumbers": true,
  "requireSpecialChars": true,
  "maxAge": 90,
  "preventReuse": 24
}
```

#### Session Management
- Secure session handling
- Automatic session timeout
- Concurrent session limits
- Session invalidation

### 2. Audit Logging

#### Event Logging
```json
{
  "eventTypes": [
    "authentication",
    "authorization",
    "data_access",
    "system_changes",
    "security_alerts"
  ],
  "logFormat": {
    "timestamp": "ISO8601",
    "actor": "string",
    "action": "string",
    "resource": "string",
    "status": "string",
    "metadata": "object"
  }
}
```

#### Monitoring and Alerts
- Real-time security monitoring
- Anomaly detection
- Incident response automation
- Compliance reporting

### 3. Secure Development

#### Code Security
- Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST)
- Dynamic Analysis Security Testing (DAST)
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Code review requirements

#### Secure Build Process
- Reproducible builds
- Container image scanning
- Artifact signing
- Supply chain security

## Compliance

### 1. Standards Compliance
- SOC 2 Type II
- ISO 27001
- GDPR
- HIPAA (where applicable)

### 2. Privacy Controls
- Data minimization
- Purpose limitation
- Consent management
- Data retention policies

## Security Response

### 1. Incident Response
```yaml
response_phases:
  - preparation
  - detection
  - analysis
  - containment
  - eradication
  - recovery
  - lessons_learned
```

### 2. Vulnerability Management
- Regular security assessments
- Penetration testing
- Bug bounty program
- Patch management

## Security Recommendations

### 1. Development Environment
- Use secure development tools
- Implement secure coding practices
- Regular security training
- Code security reviews

### 2. Production Environment
- Regular security updates
- Infrastructure hardening
- Access monitoring
- Backup encryption

### 3. Third-Party Integrations
- Vendor security assessment
- API security reviews
- Integration monitoring
- Access limitations
